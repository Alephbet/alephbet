  localStorage)
* Supports multiple variants and goals
* Tracks unique visitors and goal completions
* Flexible triggers
* Ideal for use with page and fragment caching
* Developer-friendly for both usage and contirbution (using npm / webpack)

## What does AlephBet mean?

Aleph (אלף) Bet (בית) are the first two letters in the Hebrew alphabet. Similar to A and B.

## Inspiration

AlephBet was heavily inspired by Optimizely (sans WYSIWYG and reporting) and
[Cohorts.js](https://github.com/jamesyu/cohorts).
The code structure and some code elements were taken from cohorts.js, with some notable changes to terminology and
built-in support for unique goals and visitor tracking.

## Quick Start

* Make sure your Google Universal analytics is set up.
* [Download](https://github.com/gingerlime/alephbet/releases/latest) and include `alephbet.min.js` in the head section of your HTML.
* Create an experiment:

```javascript
var button_color_experiment = new AlephBet.Experiment({
  name: 'button color',  // the name of this experiment; required.
  variants: {  // variants for this experiment; required.
    blue: {
      activate: function() {  // activate function to execute if variant is selected
        $('#my-btn').attr('style', 'color: blue;');
      }
    },
    red: {
      activate: function() {
        $('#my-btn').attr('style', 'color: red;');
      }
    }
  },
});
```

* Track goals for your experiment:

```javascript
// creating a goal
var button_clicked_goal = new AlephBet.Goal('button clicked');
$('#my-btn').on('click', function() {
  // The chosen variant will be tied to the goal automatically
  button_clicked_goal.complete();
});

// adding experiment to the goal
button_clicked_goal.add_experiment(button_color_experiment);

// alternatively - add the goal to the experiment
button_color_experiment.add_goal(button_clicked_goal);

// tracking non-unique goals, e.g. page views
var page_views = new AlephBet.Goal('page view', {unique: false});
```

* view results on your Google Analytics Event Tracking Section. The experiment name + variation will be assigned to  `actions`, and Visitors or Goals to `label`. e.g.
  - action: `button color | red`, label: `Visitors` : unique count of visitors assigned to the `red` variant.
  - `button color | blue`, `button clicked` : unique visitors clicking on the button assigned to the `blue` variant.
  - `button color | red`, `viewed page` : count of pages viewed by all visitors (not-unique) *after* the experiment started.

* **important note**: whilst Google Analytics is the *easiest* way to start playing with Alephbet, it's definitely not the best way to use it. GA starts sampling events after you reach a certain volume, and the built-in GA adapter does not support more advanced features like [cross-device tracking](https://github.com/Alephbet/alephbet/wiki/User-based-and-Cross-device-tracking). If you're serious about running A/B tests, I would urge you to consider using [Lamed](https://github.com/Alephbet/lamed), [Gimel](https://github.com/Alephbet/gimel) or another backend instead.

## Advanced Usage

### Recommended Usage Pattern

AlephBet was meant to be used across different pages, tracking multiple goals over simultaneous experiments. It is
therefore recommended to keep all experiments in one javascript file, shared across all pages. This allows sharing goals
across different experiments. Experiments can be triggered based on a set of conditions, allowing to fine-tune the
audience for the experiments (e.g. mobile users, logged-in etc).

### Triggers

Experiments automatically start by default. However, a trigger function can be provided, to limit the audience or the
page(s) where the experiment "kicks-off".
```javascript
var button_color_experiment = new AlephBet.Experiment({
  name: 'button color',
  trigger: function() {
    return window.location.href.match(/pricing/);
  },
  variants: { // ...
  },
});

// triggers can be assigned to a variable and shared / re-used
var logged_in_user = function() { return document.cookie.match(/__session/); };
var mobile_browser = function() { // test if mobile browser };

var big_header_experiment = new AlephBet.Experiment({
  name: 'big header',
  trigger: function() { return logged_in_user() && mobile_browser(); },
  // ...
});
```

**NOTE**: once a user participates in an experiment, the trigger is no longer checked. See #9

### Sample size

You can specify a `sample` float (between 0.0 and 1.0) to limit the number of visitors participating in an experiment.

### Weights

Whilst `sample` will limit the entire experiment to a subset of potential participants, `weight` allows
you to apply a weighted-random selection of variants. This can be considered a first step (manual) way
to implement [Multi Armed Bandit testing](https://conversionxl.com/blog/bandit-tests/).

NOTE: Weights can be any integer value. **Do not use floats**. You can use any number, but it's probably easiest
      to treat it as a percentage, e.g. use weights of 80, 20 to allocate ~80% to one variant vs. ~20% to the other.

```
var button_color_experiment = new AlephBet.Experiment({
  name: 'button color',  // the name of this experiment; required.
  variants: {  // variants for this experiment; required.
    blue: {
      activate: function() {  // activate function to execute if variant is selected
        $('#my-btn').attr('style', 'color: blue;');
      },
      weight: 50 // optional, can be any integer value
    },
    red: {
      activate: function() {
        $('#my-btn').attr('style', 'color: red;');
      },
      weight: 50
    }
  },
});
```

### Visitors

Visitors will be tracked once they participate in an experiment (and only once). Once a visitor participates in an
experiment, the same variant will always be shown to them. If visitors are excluded from the sample, they will be
permanently excluded from seeing the experiment. Triggers however will be checked more than once, to allow launching
experiments under specific conditions for the same visitor.

### User-based / Cross-device tracking

You can now pass a `user_id` to the experiment as an optional parameter.
This allows experiment to work across devices on a per-user basis.

```javascript
var button_color_experiment = new AlephBet.Experiment({
  name: 'button color',
  user_id: get_user_id(),  // pass over the unique user id bound to this experiment
  trigger: function() {
    // do not trigger this expeirment without a user_id
    return get_user_id() && other_condition();
  },
  variants: {  // variants for this experiment; required.
    blue: {
      activate: function() {  // activate function to execute if variant is selected
        $('#my-btn').attr('style', 'color: blue;');
      }
    },
    red: {
      activate: function() {
        $('#my-btn').attr('style', 'color: red;');
      }
    }
  },
});

// do not assign goals without a user_id
if (get_user_id()) {
  button_color_experiment.add_goal(my_goal);
}
```

Notes:

* For user-based tracking, make sure you *always* have a user_id. Do not mix visitors (without an id) and users (with an id) in the same experiment.
* Cross-device tracking only works with the [Gimel](https://github.com/Alephbet/gimel), [Lamed](https://github.com/Alephbet/lamed) or keen.io tracking backends. It does not work with Google Analytics.

See this [Wiki page](https://github.com/Alephbet/alephbet/wiki/User-based-and-Cross-device-tracking) for more information

### Goals

Goals are uniquely tracked by default. i.e. if a goal is set to measure how many visitors clicked on a button, multiple
clicks won't generate another goal completion. Only one per visitor. Non-unique goals can be set by passing `unique: false` to the goal when creating it.

Goals will only be tracked if the experiment was launched and a variant selected before. Tracking goals is therefore
safe and idempotent (unless unique is false).

Here's a short sample of tracking multiple goals over multiple experiments:

```javascript
// main goal - button click
var button_click_goal = new AlephBet.Goal('button click');
$('#my-btn').on('click', function() {
  button_clicked_goal.complete();
});

// engagement - any click on the page
var engagement = new AlephBet.Goal('engagement');
$('html').on('click', function() {
  engagement.complete();
});

var all_goals = [button_click_goal, engagement];

// experiments
var button_color_experiment = new AlephBet.Experiment({ /* ... */ });
var buy_button_cta_experiment = new AlephBet.Experiment({ /* ... */ });

// adding all goals to experiments
_(all_goals).each(function (goal) {
  button_color_experiment.add_goal(goal);
  buy_button_cta_experiment.add_goal(goal);
});

// alternatively, you can use the add_goals method and pass it an array of goals
button_color_experiment.add_goals(all_goals);
buy_button_cta_experiment.add_goals(all_goals);
```

### Custom Tracking Adapter

AlephBet comes with a built-in Google Analytics adapter and three, currently experimental, [adapters](../../wiki/Tips-&-Caveats#persistent-queue-adapters) with potentially better accuracy:

[Persistent Queue GA Adapter](../../wiki/Tips-&-Caveats#persistentqueuegoogleanalyticsadapter)

[Persistent Queue Keen Adapter](../../wiki/Tips-&-Caveats#persistentqueuekeenadapter)

[Gimel](https://github.com/Alephbet/gimel) adapter

[Lamed](https://github.com/Alephbet/lamed) adapter

Creating custom adapters is however very easy.

Here's an example for integrating an adapter for [keen.io](https://keen.io)

(For a more complete implementation, you should use the built-in `Alephbet.PersistentQueueKeenAdapter`)

```html
<script src="https://d26b395fwzu5fz.cloudfront.net/3.2.4/keen.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="alephbet.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    window.keen_client = new Keen({
        projectId: "ENTER YOUR PROJECT ID",
        writeKey: "ENTER YOUR WRITE KEY"
    });
    var tracking_adapter = {
        experiment_start: function(experiment, variant) {
            keen_client.addEvent(experiment.name, {variant: variant, event: 'participate'});
        },
        goal_complete: function(experiment, variant, event_name, _props) {
            keen_client.addEvent(experiment.name, {variant: variant, event: event_name});
        }
    };
    var my_experiment = new AlephBet.Experiment({
        name: 'my experiment',
        variants: { // ...
        },
        tracking_adapter: tracking_adapter,
        // ...
    });
</script>

```

### Custom Storage Adapter

Similar to the tracking adapter, you can customize the storage adapter. AlephBet uses localStorage by default, but if you want to use cookies or customize how data is persisted on the client, creating an adapter is very easy.

Here's a simple example of a cookie storage adapter with expiry of 30 days, using
[js-cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie):

```html
<script src="/path/to/js.cookie.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    // NOTE: using JSON stringify / parse to allow storing more complex values
    var storage_adapter = {
        set: function(key, value) {
            Cookies.set(key, JSON.stringify(value), {expires: 30});
        },
        get: function(key) {
            try { return JSON.parse(Cookies.get(key)); } catch(e) { return Cookies.get(key); }
        }
    };
    var my_experiment = new AlephBet.Experiment({
        name: 'my experiment',
        variants: { // ...
        },
        storage_adapter: storage_adapter,
        // ...
    });
```

### Debug mode

To set more verbose logging to the browser console, use `AlephBet.options.debug = true`.

### Other install options

* download `alephbet.min.js` from the `dist` folder on github
* `npm install alephbet`
* `bower install alephbet`

## Analyzing results

AlephBet is built for developers, so there's no fancy interface or WYSIWYG editors. The best way to analyze the results
and determine the best variant from an experiment is to look at the raw data and calculate the statistical significance.
A couple of recommended resources:

* [Thumbtack's ABBA A/B Test Calculator](https://www.thumbtack.com/labs/abba/)
* [Evan Miller's A/B Testing tools](http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/)

## Development

AlephBet uses npm / browserify with the following 3rd party libraries:

* [lodash](https://lodash.com/) (using a custom build, to save space)
* [store.js](https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js) - for localStorage

### Commands

* `npm run build` - to build both development and minified version + prerequisites
* `npm run watch` - will watch files and re-build using `watchify`
