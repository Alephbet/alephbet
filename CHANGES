* 0.8.0 Added PersistentQueueGoogleAnalyticsAdapter
    - PersistentQueueGoogleAnalyticsAdapter stores tracking events into storage first, and only clears them after a
      callback
    - storage defaults to LocalStorageAdapter, but can be swapped
    - This is an optional adapter and not (yet?) the default

* 0.7.1 small internal refactoring
    - added name, variants, and variant_names as attributes of Experiment

* 0.7.0 new convenience methods: add_goals / add_experiments
    - allow passing a list instead of one item

* 0.6.2 internal API improvements
    - calling activate before setting in storage
    - passing the experiment to the activate callback
    - making sure we return the value from in_sample

* 0.6.1 small bug fix
    - cannot read propery 'length' of undefined when unlinked goal is complete

* 0.6.0 - BREAKING changes if using the built-in google analytics adapter
    - assignment of experiment name and variation were combined
      into actions, and visitors/goals into label.
      It seems to be easier to look / process results this way
    - small fix to logging of options

* 0.5.0 - BREAKING changes
    - tracking adapters : renamed onInitialize to experiment_start and onEvent to goal_complete
