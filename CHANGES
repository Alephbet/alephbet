* 0.21.0 upgrade to webpacker 5 + jest (@joker-777)
    - reduced the package size
    - removed lodash dependency
    - introduce jest + webpacker 5

* 0.20.1 logging small fix

* 0.20.0 adding RailsAdapter + internal refactoring

* 0.19.1 exposing LamedAdapter though Alephbet

* 0.19.0 adding LamedAdapter (inherits from GimelAdapter)
    - see https://github.com/Alephbet/lamed
    - the lamed and gimel backend APIs are identical.
      However, gimel and lamed storage makes uuid generation different.
      Technically, updating the GimelAdapter should be ok, but can break
      backwards compatibility for *currently running experiments* (only).
      It was therefore sensible to create a separate adapter for lamed (and
      also for future changes)* 0.18.3 moved from node-uuid to uuid

* 0.18.2 removed source maps from minified version

* 0.18.1 changed main to point to dist/alephbet.min.js

* 0.18.0 moving from browserify to webpack
         and upgrading dependencies to latest versions

* 0.17.1 throwing real errors (contributed by @joker-777)

* 0.17.0 added weight option (contributed by @szymansd)
    - you can now add a `weight` key to your variants
      and the random pick will be weighted accordingly.

* 0.16.0 upgrade store.js to v2

* 0.15.0 BREAKING changes (only if you wrote your own tracking adapter)
    - User-based / Cross-device tracking
    - If you use your own tracking adapter, you'll have to change it.
      * `experiment_start` now expects `experiment` as the first parameter
        (instead of just the `experiment_name`)
      * `goal_complete` now also accepts the `experiment` as the first parameter
        and also the goal `props` as an extra parameter.

    - internal refactor to remove `value` from GA events
    - sending GA events as {'nonInteraction': 1} to avoid
      Alephbet affecting the bounce rate

* 0.9.2 bugfix for unique queue names

* 0.9.1 using unique queue names
    - if adapters are used in conjunction this might cause
      errors if they share the same queue

* 0.9.0 Added PersistentKeenAdapter
    - added PersistentQueueKeenAdapter similar to the GA persistent adapter

* 0.8.0 Added PersistentQueueGoogleAnalyticsAdapter
    - PersistentQueueGoogleAnalyticsAdapter stores tracking events into storage first, and only clears them after a
      callback
    - storage defaults to LocalStorageAdapter, but can be swapped
    - This is an optional adapter and not (yet?) the default

* 0.7.1 small internal refactoring
    - added name, variants, and variant_names as attributes of Experiment

* 0.7.0 new convenience methods: add_goals / add_experiments
    - allow passing a list instead of one item

* 0.6.1 small bug fix
    - cannot read propery 'length' of undefined when unlinked goal is complete

* 0.6.0 - BREAKING changes if using the built-in google analytics adapter

      It seems to be easier to look / process results this way
